# Java-TF
Fundamentos de Programação
This project intends to create a simple app for seat reservations on airplanes.



Resumo em inglês: 

  I have developed a Java system to manage seat reservations on an airplane. The "Aviao" class represents each airplane, storing details such as model, flight number, arrays for passengers, seat statuses, and available seat categories. I implemented methods like adicionarPassageiro to add passengers in different categories (such as economy or business class) to available seats, and exibirLugaresOcupados to display occupied seats. The Categoria class defines acceptable seat types and validates if a category is suitable for reservation.

  The main program (Main) provides a simple user interaction through a menu. It allows users to add passengers with their names, card numbers, and desired seat categories. Additionally, it displays occupied seats and gracefully terminates when the user chooses to exit. I utilized methods from the Aviao, Categoria, Passageiro, and Cartao classes to manage and display information related to seat reservations.
